    //I want to add psychic that tells you how many credits to get you what but that is the passive so its nothing crazy
    //Could also add a passive that's like fragile strenth (hollow knight ref ifykyk) 
    //Could add a passive that if you skip your turn 4 times you can hit an ultimate attack, should make a cool like text entrance to it
    //Could make a gamble passive, where if you choose to skip you take double damage, BUT you then deal double damage
    //Then there would be a normal, where you get the normal amount of credits, like with everyting the credits you start with should change
    //TODO: (RESOLVED) make a credits class
    //Could make a passive called brick wall, your shots can miss 50% more but you take 30% less damage + 20 credits though
    //TODO: ADD A MISS CHANCE COUNTER -> LUCK POINTS
